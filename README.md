Hello, welcome to the AGORA Media repository.
I made this repository to create a smooth workflow within us.

If you're a non-coder then you can request feature. Or if you find issues then you can report it here.
If you're someone new to github then please move around and explore what github has to offer you.

## Contribute
Please follow these rules before you contribute or request new features.
<br>

* Put comments while you are adding or editing something in the codebase.
* Use tabs instead of space. Make sure the tab is 2 spaced.
* While requesting new features, make sure it is not previously requested. Same thing goes with the issues.
